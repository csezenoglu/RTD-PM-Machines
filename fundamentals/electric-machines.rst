Electric Machines
*****************

Electrical machines in general are energy converters. Electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy in motors, whereas mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy in generators. "Electric motors and generators of all kinds m a y be classed as electromechanical energy converters. Such devices embody three essential parts: (1) an electric system, (2) a mechanical system, and (3) a coupling field"[1]. One way to classify electric motors is by the source of its coupling field.The coupling field can be produced either by current carrying conductors or by permanent magnets. Those machines with permanent magnets as a source for producing the coupling field are called permanent magnet machines. [1993 PhD Axial flux permanent magnet servo motor with sixteen poles]

Permanent Magnet Machines
=========================

Permanent magnet machines use permanent magnets as a source of flux. Direct current machines have permanent magnets on the stator, and alternating current machines have permanent magnets on the rotor. Depending on h o w the magnets are fixed in the machine, the ac permanent magnet machines are called either permanent magnet machines with buried magnets or permanent magnet machines with surface mounted magnets.
