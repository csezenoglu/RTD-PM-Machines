"Determination of the electric loading necessitates the use of a voltage model based on the structure. The determination of magnetic loading concerns the optimization of magnet size, shape and orientation." Power output per unit volume was given. Windage losses and filling factor were calculated. Rotor stress for different number of poles and stages, generator efficiency versus stator turns per phase graphics were showed. Case machine was 50 kVA, 420 V, 50.000 rpm and 92% efficiency. Thus, there was any experimental machine [El Hasan et al., 2000].

Best range of outer diameter of rotor was below 27 cm and best range of air gap was between 2 mm and 6 mm. they noted that two types of bearings might be used that air and magnetic bearing. Performance analysis was based on 50 kW, 400 V, 50,000 rpm and 6 poles generator [Sadeghierad et al., 2007].

Sadeghierad et al. investigated magnetic modeling of three rotors, two stators, air cored high speed AFPM generator. In order to present magnetic model of AFPM machine, lumped circuit model was used. In addition, machine losses were presented with three main subject: mechanical, stator and rotor losses. 30 kW, 30,000 rpm, 400 V, 6 poles generator was designed and FEM results were acquired. Especially, flux leakage model between the magnets was detailed [Sadeghierad et al., 2008].  Main design parameters of FEM simulation were presented in another detailed work [Sadeghierad et al., 2009]. In addition, particularly investigation of Lambda=Do/Di was studied. Air gap flux density, voltage and efficiency variations versus a range of Lambda were presented. Inductance calculations with the aid of magnetic model was described. The best range for Lambda was found between about 0.3 to 0.5 [Sadeghierad et al., 2009].

Per phase Model
---------------

Wang et al. investigated performance calculation and optimization of coreless one stator two rotor generator. Per phase equivalent circuit was produced and equivalent circuit parameters calculated by FEM and classical theory. Temperature dependent stator winding resistance, rms value of phase EMF, eddy-current losses, steady state electromagnetic torque, input shaft power formulations were described. They noted that there is no clear definition for main and leakage inductances in a coreless or slotless machine. Powell's method and the population based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm were used for optimization that minimize the amount of PM material or maximize the efficiency of generator. As well as mechanical stress analysis of rotor discs were done. 10\ \sfrac{A}{{mm}^2} current density was proposed and was confirmed experimentally. For ease of connecting winding coils, four circular bus bars were used.

Matsuoka and Obata presented a design algorithm for coreless AFPM and cored RFPM motors. Two main factors were used for evaluating motor design parameters that motor mobility and torque constant values. Motor mobility and torque constant were speed/torque and torque/current respectively. They calculated based on analytical formulations, torque-speed and torque-current graphs. Relationship between division ratio of thickness of permanent magnet and thickness of coil and motor mobility graphics were given. In addition, comparison between measured and calculated values about two types of motors was showed. The algorithm had two procedures: first, assuming the motor size is fixed, second, motor is required to meet load conditions. Last, motor parameters sketch is well prepared [Matsuoka and Obata, 1989].

Winding Design
--------------

Takano et al. investigated optimum values for magnet and armature winding thickness for one rotor one stator motors. Armature winding resistance, current and distribution of air gap magnetic flux density were determined analytically. In addition, starting torque expression was introduced. In order to keep the copper loss of armature winding minimum, the optimal ratio of the PM thickness to armature winding thickness is 2:1. The main drawback of calculations is some variables in equations should be measured from base motor for determining its values. There was a base motor that was measured for determining constants in equations and three motors for calculations [Takano et al., 1992].

Reed and Bakhoum investigated performance of PCB stator AFPM generator. Three phase steady state model was used. Power curve and some oscilloscope views of 16 poles, 4 coils per phase, 100 W at 500 rpm generator. Four layer PCB was constructed. They used off grid small wind turbine applications [Reed and Bakhoum, 2008].

Del Ferraro et al. investigated coil and magnet shape optimization of ironless AFPM machine. 3D FEA was used for analysis. Also torque equation was converted and it depends only coil shape. Optimization was carried out in terms of maximum torque produced per joule loss. Coil and magnet shape optimization and pole number effect on machine torque graphs were presented. Comparisons among different coil and magnet shapes that trapezoidal, rhomboidal, hexagonal and circular coils and trapezoidal, rectangular and circular magnets. In this work radial length and axial thickness were fixed. In conclusion, they noted that, best performances in terms of torque produced can be optained with circular shapes both on magnets and coils [Del Ferraro et al., 2007].

Kamper et al. investigated analysis of air cored nonoverlapping concentrated stator windings. Analytic calculations and 2D FEA were presented. Element, layer, coil and phase voltage steps were used for voltage calculations. In addition, stator winding factors were investigated in detail. Per unit torque and mass of copper graphs for different windings were also given. Compared with the torque performance of three different windings that were normal overlapping, concentrated coil and phase group windings. Concentrated windings had better torque performance than with normal overlapping windings. Also, they noted that higher pole number machines use less copper then low pole number machines [Kamper et al., 2008]. 

Rotor Design
------------

El-Hasan and Luk investigated magnet shape and distance between the adjacent magnets optimization for reducing harmonics. At high speeds, eddy currents in the rotors could become dominant. because the rotor is exposed to a time-varying magnetic field from the spatial harmonics of the stator current. 3D FEA was used and experimental validation was present. Distance of magnetic poles versus different harmonic graphics were showed. Also, comparison between semicircular and trapezoidal magnet shapes was discussed. Minimum THD was found on 6 mm distance. Single turn coil was used [El-Hasan and Luk, 2003].

Sadeghierad et al. analyzed back iron thickness of coreless AFPM. Matlab Simulink and FEM simulations were done, and Matlab Simulink figure was presented. Flux density, voltage, output power and efficiency results were given that varied back iron thickness. Therefore, back iron thickness varied from 1 to 3 cm. In addition, self and mutual inductances of machine were calculated. Particularly at this work, thickness of the back iron was determined at least 2 cm [Sadeghierad et al., 2009]. 

Permanent Magnets
-----------------

NdFeB magnets have great potential for considerably improving the performance–to–cost ratio for many applications [Gieras et al., 2008].

Thermal Analysis
----------------

Mbidi et al. studied thermal analysis of two stage coreless AFPM machine. Thermal lumped circuit was presented about two stage coreless AFPM machine. Heat transfer coefficient (h) formulation was given. They noted that air cooling is sufficient for low and medium power machines. However, it shuld be T_{PM}<120\ \degc and T_{ST}<150\ \degc [Mbidi et al., 2000].

Howey et al. investigated measurement of stator heat transfer coefficients (Nusselt numbers) of air cooled AFPM machines. An average value of heat transfer coefficient h derived from CFD (computataional fluid dynamics) and/or experiment rather than lumped thermal analysis. Also some formulations about Nusselt numbers were given but there was no relation between them. Local and averaged stator Nusselt numbers for different air gap sizes graphics were given. Comparison with real works of other papers but there was not a correlation. In this paper, literature review was good. Afterwards, experimental rig that a geometric mockup of a rotor stator disc system was constructed [Howey et al., 2009].

Mechanical Analysis
-------------------

Mbidi et al. presented mechanical design considerations of a two stage coreless axial flux PM machine. Deflection of rotor discs was investigated with FEA. Attraction force between the rotor discs was also formulated. In addition, thermal analysis was studied. Thermal lumped circuit was presented about two stage coreless AFPM machine. They noted that air cooling is sufficient for low and medium power machines. However, it shuld be T_{PM}<120\ \degc and T_{ST}<150\ \degc.  The machine was 300kW, 2300 rpm and 40 poles [Mbidi et al., 2000].

Luk and Hassan investigated back iron design for high speed generators. ANSYS based 3D finite element model was used. Removing iron at certain regions in the rotor may reduce the flux slightly but significant weight advantage could be gained. Analyzed generator was 20 kVA at 60 krpm [Luk and Hassan, 2005].

Performance
-----------

Campbell presented performance of one rotor, one stator brushed coreless AFPM motor.  Two experimental motor that one of fan and the other one bicycle motor investigated in detail. Output power, torque, speed and efficiency graphics of two types of motors had done. Experimental fan motor had 8 poles, 39 coils, 120 W and bicycle motor had 10 poles, 31 coils and 180 W. Both motors had approximately below 60% efficiency. Single and double layer windings were used and also connection diagrams were given. He noted that with a wave winding there was a non integer number of coils per pole. In addition, study of power losses was done [Campbell, 1979].  

Caricchi et al. investigated generator performance of two rotor one stator water cooled AFPM machine. Torque equation was given. No load power loss and voltage regulation graphics was showed for 16 poles, 48 coils, 72 kW, 3000 rpm, 92% efficiency machine. Winding coils were rhomboidal shape and had a water duct for cooling. Because of the negligible armature reaction, it had very low value of the machine inductance. Therefore, AFPM,s with coreless winding have rms output voltage which varies almost linearly with load current. Also, they noted that Litz wirez allow a great reduction of the eddy current loss [Caricchi et al., 1998]. 

Loss Calculation
----------------

Stator Losses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wang and Camper investigated evaluation of eddy current losses in ironless stator. They presented a hybrid method that combines standard analytical formulation and 2D FEM aided calculations with layers and slices. In order to achieve the 3D nature of machine, they used layers in axial direction and slices in radial direction. The drawback of the method was that needs several 2D field solutions. Standard analytical method alone gives value that 43% less from hybrid method. Calculated and measured resistance limited eddy current losses were given. Also, flux density of different slices and layers were shown at graphs. In experimental machine the coils were replaced by bunches of conductors. They noted that Litz wires were more expensive and poor filling factor. In addition, coils are made of several parallel wires created a new problem that circulating current between any of these parallel paths. Suppressing circulating eddy currents by wire twisting. Measured circulating currents were given about twisted wires [Wang and Camper, 2002]. After two years, Wang and Camper presented same work about calculation of eddy currents in ironless stator of AFPM machine. Calculation method was described in detail. Air gap flux distribution and eddy current loss graphics were presented. Also compared with calculated and measured results. Experimental machine was 300 kW, 550 V, 40 poles and 60 coils generator [Wang and Camper, 2004].
