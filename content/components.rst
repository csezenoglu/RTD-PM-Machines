Permanent Magnets
=================

The following factors can be considered in the selection of magnets :cite:`sadeghierad:2008leakage`

- Magnetic properties (Br, Hc, BHmax etc.)
- Ability to work at higher temperatures (SmCo can operate at higher temperatures than NdFeB.)
- Magnet price (SmCo is more expensive than NdFeB.)

Several common materials are used in permanent magnet machines. These include Nd-Fe-B (Neodium-iron-boron) and SmCo (Samarium-cobalt) magnets. Neodymium magnets have lower eddy current losses, and the price performance ratio of neodymium magnets is better than that of samarium cobalt. For these reasons, magnetized machines mostly use neodymium magnets. The magnet model consists of a magnetic resistor and a mmk (mmf: magnetomotive force) :cite:`sadeghierad:2009detail`.
