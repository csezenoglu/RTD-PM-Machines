Carter's Coefficient
====================

The carter’s coefficient is a parameter that can be used to estimate the contracted or effective slot pitch in case of armature with open or semi enclosed slots. It is the function of the ratio Wo/lg where Wo is slot opening and lg is air gap length. Kcs=Wo/lg or

The Carter’s gap co-efficient (Kcs) is the ratio of slot width to gap length.

The formula which gives value of Kcs directly is Kcs = 1/1+ 5lg/Ws

For parallel sided open slots, Kcs = 2/π[ tan -1 y – 1/y log √(1+/y2)] where y = Ws/2lg.
